## Running this fix

Remember! Run `nvm use` when you're in this directory!

If you have `yarn` installed, you don't have to do _anything_ except run `npm run demo` to set this up. If you see _no output_, that is the expected outcome.

Poke around in src/index.ts and you'll see that the types work as expected.
